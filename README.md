# Git Flow:

## Create (also need to create remote repo and connect it with local repo "git remote origin repo-url") / Clone git repo:

- "git init" - for creating
- "git clone repo-name" - for cloning

## Create files and / or make changes to it

## Moving file changes to working branch (default branch is main (master), but you can create new ones with "git branch -b branch-name"):

- "git add ." - moves all changes for commit
- "git add (file name)" - moves named file changes for commit
- "git commit -m "message" - commits all changes to branch

## Sending our working branch to remote git respository "git push origin branch-name"

## Staring new branch but firste geeting all aupdates from main (master branch) with "git pull"

## ----

- "git status" - to see status whant was updated
- "git log" - to see commits what changed what
- "git branch" - to see branch all branch
- "git checkout -b (name of new branch)" - creating new branch and transfer to it
- "git checkout (branch name)" - transfer to branch you named
- "git merge (branch name)" - merges named branch with main branch
- "git branch -d (branch name)" - delete branche (using after merge)
